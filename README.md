## Demo:

### Main Page

Before displaying any data the user must be authenticated. A POST request is made with a username and password which are retrieved from environment variables. An auth token is returned on a successfull request and it gets stored in the local storage. No need to authenticate by clicking on the button since the authentication happens when the page loads. A timestamp is stored in localstorage when the token is generated. A useEffect runs every 30 seconds to check if the time lapsed between the token generated and current time is greated than 9 minutes. If it is, a new POST request is made to the refresh token endpoint using existing token to get new token and stored in local storage. This cycle continues indefinitely.

### Call Details

All call details which are returned in the nodes payload for each call are displayed including notes in a popover.

### Archive Call
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75773436/155866741-ebeb1b6e-3cb4-4873-97c9-7e6821118160.png)

Each button click is accompanied by a toast on top of the page to notify the success of the action. Call is archived by making a PUT request with the id of the call.

### Multiple Archive

Archive multiple calls by selecting each call with a checkbox which gets stored in an array. Then the archive all button takes each PUT request one by one and executes it using [Promise.all()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all).

### Add Note
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75773436/155866763-3288bf57-86d0-4e3e-8701-fe931ca4b810.png)

A note can be added to a call using popover.

### Pagination

Pagination works by storing the offset in a state and updating the state by 10 on each button click. This offset gets used in each subsequent GET request for fetching calls.

### Filtering
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75773436/155866783-4e00faec-7edd-446c-976d-a0dd1db3c9e0.png)

Filter call by type such as archived, missed, answered, etc.

## Error

### Pusher
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75773436/155866788-1d67ce02-3415-476c-be4e-3484f2043ca9.png)

Unfortunately, using the pusher sdk I was not able to subscribe to real time data to update my state. I kept getting 403 error as authentication was not working.
